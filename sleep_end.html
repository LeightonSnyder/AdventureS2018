    <h1>You wake up.</h1>
    <h2>It's 8 am. The year is 2020. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has just been elected president in a surprise upset against Kermit the Frog.</h2>
    <h2>You realise, had you been awake and politically active, you could have been the deciding force to put Kermit in the White House.</h2>
    <h2>Your only respite is the knowledge that The Rock, the two time academy award winning actor, will no longer be in movies.</h2>
    <h2>But then you die, as you haven't eaten in years.</h2>
    <h3>THE END</h3>
