    <h1>You arrive at the event.</h1>
    <h2>You discover that the extra credit opportunity is gender specific, and that you must identify as a binary gender to participate. You prepare to berate the closest worker for their complicity in the perpetuation of the establishment's transphobic heteronormative agenda.</h2>
    <h2>However, you realize you forgot to check your privilege, as you are making the life of an underpaid working class individual even more difficult than it already is, and the stress you'd cause could affect their health, driving up their healthcare costs and sending them into financial ruin.</h2>
    <h2> But, by not fighting back, you are only strenghtening the patriarchal establishment. A establishment that relies on divisions between social classes to stay in power. Divisions that would be deepened should you, an upper middle class student, question the moral integrity of an unskilled worker.</h2>
    <h2>Perhaps, you think, if you were to just treat people as individuals and interact with them meaningfully, you could avoid some of these conflicts and come to an understanding.</h2>
    <h2>You take off your headset. The year is 2022. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is president and now the US leads the world with a fully funded public educational system and state of the art VR classrooms.</h2>
    <h2>CONGRATULATIONS!</h2>
    <h2>You have passed your Social Rationalization Exam!</h2>
    <h3>You are still capitalist bourgeoisie swine.</h3>
